# Zooey Miller
I'm Zooey, I'm a full stack web developer.

I graduated from the Founders and Coders full stack Javascript bootcamp in London, and then went on to mentor at the London, Nazareth and Gaza Founders and Coders campuses.

I'm passionate about user focused design and development, functional
    programming, and accessibility.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZooeyMiller) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zooeymiller), and on zooeyxmiller@gmail.com if you need to email me.
