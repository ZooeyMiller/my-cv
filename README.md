# Zooey Miller

I'm Zooey, I'm a full stack web developer.

I graduated from the Founders and Coders full stack Javascript bootcamp in London, and then went on to mentor
at the London, Nazareth and Gaza Founders and Coders campuses.

My main interest in terms of technology is strongly typed functional programming. I learned Elm towards the end
of my time at Founders and Coders, and have been learning Haskell in my spare time since February 2018. I am also
passionate about software accessibility.

I enjoy keeping up with what's going on in tech and being involved in the community by attending meetups and conferences,
and this year have attended JSconf EU, FullStack Conference and Haskell eXchange.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZooeyMiller) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zooeymiller), and on zooeyxmiller@gmail.com if you need to email me.
